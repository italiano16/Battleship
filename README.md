 # Battleship
OSU Engineering 1181 Software design project to create a game using MATLAB and the COE provided simple game engine <br />

**Battleship**: Simple battleship game dispayed using simple game engine with 3 levels of AI difficulty <br />
 <ul> 
  <li><i>Easy Difficulty</i>
    <ul>
      <li>Random guessing by program for attacks</li>
      <li>8x8 grid</li>
      <li>4 ships</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><i>Medium Difficulty</i>
    <ul>
      <li>Algorithm to randomly guess until a ship is found, then guess all spots that the ship could be until ship is destroyed</li>
